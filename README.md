# **NLP Project: Entity Extraction & Deep Learning Classification**

This project applies modern NLP techniques to extract structured information from text and build deep learning models for genre classification.

---

## **Part 1 — Entity & Relation Extraction**

* Compared **spaCy NER** with **spaCy + HuggingFace Transformers**
* Extracted entities and relations from a custom document set
* Generated and analyzed **knowledge graphs**
* Experimented with ontology design, equivalent classes, and graph interpretation

---

## **Part 2 — RNN & LSTM Classification**

* Built multiple **RNN** and **LSTM** architectures using Keras
* Trained models to predict document genre
* Compared performance across model sizes and against earlier ML baselines
* Evaluated models with accuracy and confusion matrices
